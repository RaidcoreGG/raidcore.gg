					<h2>About us</h2>
					<p>
						<b>Raidcore</b>, formerly known as "Guild Lounge", started out with the vision to create <b>third party tools</b> to enhance your Guild Wars 2 experience.
						<br>
						I think we're doing a pretty good job with that.
					</p>
					<p>
						The <a href="https://download.raidcore.gg">DESKTOP CLIENT</a> tries to make right what others (including ArenaNet) have been doing wrong for so long.
						<br>
						The all-in-one solution to manage your accounts, addons, combat logs and on top of that you also get some handy insights.
					</p>
					<p>
						In-game <a href="addons">ADDONS</a> developed by us, as well as an opportunity for community creators to distribute their own addons.
						<br>
						A central hub to publish addons, whose development just became a lot easier with our <b>Addon Framework</b>.
					</p>
					<p>
						<a href="https://raidcore.gg">LOG PARSING</a> finally puts combat data into perspective, generating not only global statistics but also individual skill performance rating.
						<br>
						Compare your performance against any other player in the game!
					</p>
					<p>With Raidcore you can:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>See global metrics about any and all encounters in the game</li>
						<li>Look up individual players or guilds and how they perform</li>
						<li>See what the most frequent squad compositions are</li>
						<li>See the best performing classes on any given encounter</li>
						<li>Link all your alt accounts to your Raidcore account to unify all your data</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				
				<section id="getting-started">
					<h2>Getting Started</h2>
					<p>
						Getting started is easy. Simply create a new account on the website. You will need to provide in addition to your desired login credentials, your Guild Wars 2 API Key to confirm your ownership of a Guild Wars 2 Account.
					</p>
					<p>
						Raidcore will automatically get your GW2 account name and associated characters. Any encounters that have been uploaded with your GW2 account in them will show up straight away in your Encounters page.
					</p>
					<p>
						We try to automatically detect if you have previously changed your account name and attribute those encounters to your new name. If that didn't work, please contact us directly and we can sort it out.
					</p>
				</section>
				
				<section id="uploading">
					<h2>Uploading Logs</h2>
					<p>
						You don't have to upload or import anything! We work closely together with <a href="https://dps.report">dps.report</a>, so all your logs are already there.
						<br>
						You can keep using dps.report or simply drop the log file into the browser window, we'll upload it to dps.report for you.
					</p>
				</section>
				
				<section id="rating-system">
					<h2>Rating System</h2>
					<p>
						We analyse combat logs generated by <a href="https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/" target="_blank">arcdps</a> and put them into perspective.
					</p>
					<p>
						To easily understand metrics at a glance, we use the same colour scheme you're already familiar with:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li> <b style="color: var(--legendary)">Legendary</b>: <span class="gt"/> 99<sup>th</sup> Percentile </li>
						<li> <b style="color: var(--ascended)">Ascended</b>: <span class="gt"/> 90<sup>th</sup> Percentile</li>
						<li> <b style="color: var(--exotic)">Exotic</b>: <span class="gt"/> 80<sup>th</sup> Percentile</li>
						<li> <b style="color: var(--rare)">Rare</b>: <span class="gt"/> 70<sup>th</sup> Percentile</li>
						<li> <b style="color: var(--masterwork)">Masterwork</b>: <span class="gt"/> 60<sup>th</sup> Percentile</li>
						<li> <b style="color: var(--fine)">Fine</b>: <span class="gt"/> 50<sup>th</sup> Percentile</li>
						<li> <b style="color: var(--basic)">Basic</b>: <span class="lt"/> 50<sup>th</sup> Percentile</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The Top 1 performance on a given category will be marked with a special icon: <span class="rank1"/>

					<h2>Encounters List</h2>
					<p>Each boss fight tracked by Raidcore is classified as an <b>encounter</b>. Encounters are the primary reporting and analytics pages in Raidcore and will have unique URLs ending in a 5 word combination. All encounter URLs are publically shareable (but not listed) so you can share them with your friends, guild and community.</p>
					<p>The encounters page lists all encounters linked to your Raidcore account, whether they have been uploaded by you or by another participant of that encounter. To view an encounter, simply click on the encounter you're interested in and it will bring you to that specific encounter's page.</p>
					<img src="static/raidar/img/intro/encounterpage.JPG"> 
					<p>You can use the filter function to filter the encounter list and find the encounter you're after. You can also sort the list by clicking on the encounter table header text.</p>
					<img src="static/raidar/img/intro/encounterfilter.JPG"> 
				</section>
				
				<section id="encounter-page">
					<h2>Encounters Page</h2>
					<p>The encounters page allows you to analyse you and your group's performance for that encounter. Most metrics are compared to the same metrics captured globally by all Raidcore users.</p>
					<img src="static/raidar/img/intro/encounterpageoverview.jpg"> 
					<p>At the top of each encounter page, the following information and functions are available</p>
					<img src="static/raidar/img/intro/encounterpageheader.jpg"> 
					<ol>
						<li>Name of the encounter</li>
						<li>Whether the encounter was a Success or Fail and elapsed time</li>
						<li>When the encounter was uploaded.</li>
						<li>Any tags or categories associated with the encounter. Clicking on this will allow you classify and tag your encounter for easier sorting later.</li>
						<li>Select what global metric you want to compare to</li>
					</ol>
					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p>The overview tab provides details of the encounter that are most important upfront. Metrics are split into 3 levels for analysis</p>
					<p></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Squad</li>
						<li>Sub Squad (Party)</li>
						<li>Individual</li>
					</ul>
					<img src="static/raidar/img/intro/encounterpagestats.jpg"> 
					<ol>
						<li>Different tabs showing various information about the encounter</li>
						<li>Squad Totals</li>
						<li>Sub-squad Totals</li>
						<li>Player name, class and archetype. Hovering over this will also show account name and participation</li>
						<li>Toggle between highlighting boss DPS or cleave DPS</li>
						<li>DPS for both boss and cleave. Hovering over the bar will also show percentile performance to the nearest percentile</li>
						<li>Total Damage taken. Hovering over the bar will also show percentile performance to the nearest percentile</li>
						<li>Toggle between showing boon uptime or boon output</li>
						<li>Primary boon metrics(MFQA)</li>
						<li>Crit, Scholar, Flanking and Barrier metrics. Hovering over each icon will also show percentile performance to the nearest percentile</li>
						<li>Bar to show uptime, dead and disconnected proportion</li>
						<li>Toggle to show phase specific statistics or total encounter</li>
					</ol>
					<h3>Buffs</h3>
					<p>The Buff tab will allow you to further look into to boon and buff uptime and output. The three options are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Boons: All boons</li>
						<li>Offensive Buffs: Offensive buffs provided by profession specific skills and traits</li>
						<li>Defensive Buffs: Defensive buffs provided by profession specific skills and traits</li>
					</ul>
					<img src="static/raidar/img/intro/encounterpagebuffs.jpg"> 
					<p>Boon output is shown in the Boon Outputs tab in encounter view as well as in the Global Stats view. Boon output in general is defined as the total amount of boons applied by a player (including to themselves). There are two measurments of boon output depending on the type of boon measured:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Intensity</b>: E.g. Might. Intensity boons are measured by a stack count. So a boon output of 100 might would mean on average, across the entire fight, the player was able to maintain 20 stacks of might on 5 players or 10 stacks of might on 10 players or any other combination.</li>
						<li><b>Duration</b>: E.g. Quickness. Duration boons are measured by a uptime percentage. So a boon output of 500% quickness would mean on average, across the entire fight, the player was able to maintain 100% quickness on 5 players or 50% quickness on 10 players or any other combination</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Boss Metrics</h3>
					<p>The Boss metrics tab shows count and/or durations related to encounter mechanics and attacks detected by Raidcore.Hovering over the header will provide additional descriptions of the mechanics listed</p>
					<img src="static/raidar/img/intro/encounterpagebossmetrics.jpg">
				</section>
				
				<section id="personal-stats">
					<h2>Personal Stats</h2>
					<p>The Personal Stats page allows you to review your overall raid performance based on specific archetype roles you play in raids across all your characters. So for example if you have 2 power tempests, across two accounts, they'll be combined into a single power tempest view on this page.</p>
					<img src="static/raidar/img/intro/personalstats.jpg"> 
					<ol>
						<li>Allows to select which level of information to see on the page.</li>
						<li>Select the Era for data shown</li>
						<li>Overall uptime across all encounters selected</li>
						<li>What archetype is shown out of Support, Power and Condition</li>
						<li>Shows the profession for that archetype and lists number of encounters played with that archetype</li>
						<li>Shows Boss and Cleave DPS across all encounters as an average and maximum</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Clicking on a bar graph will bring up a graph showing your performance over time compared to the global metrics for that particular archetype and encounter combination.</p>
					<img src="static/raidar/img/intro/profile_graph.png">
				</section>
				
				<section id="global-stats">
					<h2>Global Stats</h2>
					<p>
						The Global Stats allows you to view global metrics for every recorded encounter.
						You can see at a glance, which DPS classes are most effective on each boss and performance of these classes according to average number and top tier players.
						Simply select the encounter you're interested in and the data will update accordingly.
					</p>
					<img src="static/raidar/img/intro/globalstats.jpg"> 
					<ol>
						<li>Select which metrics you want to view</li>
						<li>Select the Era for the metrics shown</li>
						<li>Select the percentile values you want displayed on screen</li>
						<li>Full group level metrics which outline duration, DPS and damage received for groups</li>
						<li>Archetype shown from Power, Condi and Support</li>
						<li>Confidence level is a quick indicator of number of data points used to collate data. Green is a large number of data points, yellow is some and red is a few. Hovering over the icon will display exact number of data points</li>
						<li>Display boonput metrics for the archetype</li>
					</ol>

					<h2>FAQ</h2>
					<h3>How do I get GW2 API Key?</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Go to <a target="_blank" href="https://account.arena.net/applications">ArenaNet Account Applications</a> and authenticate</li>
						<li>Click the "New Key" button</li>
						<li>Name your new API key. The name must include the phrase "Raidcore" in it</li>
						<li>Raidcore only requires "account" permission</li>
						<li>Click the "Create API Key" button</li>
						<li>Your API key will now show; copy it, and paste it into the Raidcore <a href="/register.json">Register</a> form</li>
					</ol>
					<h3>It says my Account is already registered to another user</h3>
					<p>This means that an API key associated with your account has been used already by another Raidcore user to link your GW2 account. You will need to remove the API key in question (shown in the error message) from your GW2 Account, and possibly create a new API key, in order to prove your ownership of that GW2 account and register your Raidcore account.</p>
					<h3>What combat logs does Raidcore Support?</h3>
					<p>Combat logs generated by <a href="https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/" target="_blank">arcdps</a> (both uncompressed and compressed). To enable logging in ARCDPS:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Press ALT + SHIFT + T, this will bring up the ARC settings window</li>
						<li>Under the 'Config' section ensure 'SAVE EVTC LOGS ON ENCOUNTERS' is ticked</li>
						<li>We recommend also ticking 'USE NPC NAME IN EVTC PATH' for easier tracking and 'COMPRESS EVTC WITH PS (WIN 10)' to reduce the size of your logs. Note that compression requires Windows 10</li>
						<li>Logs are stored by default after each raid boss kill / attempt under 'My Documents/Guild Wars 2/addons/arcdps/arcdps.cbtlogs'</li>
					</ol>
					<h3>Can I make my info private?</h3>
					<p>You can change your privacy settings in your Account tab. There are three options to choose from:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Private</strong>: Display your account and character names to no-one but yourself</li>
						<li><strong>Squad</strong>: Display your account and character names only to participants in your specific encounter</li>
						<li><strong>Public</strong>: Show your account and character names to everyone</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Privacy options will apply to all accounts and characters linked to your Raidcore account.</p>
					<h3>What encounters are taken into account for averages?</h3>
					<p>Only encounters marked as successful runs will be included in average statistics. Averages are also isolated by different balance patches (Eras).</p>

			<h2>Getting Started</h2>
			<p>
				Getting started is easy. Simply create a new account on the website. You will need to provide your Guild Wars 2 API Key to confirm your ownership of a Guild Wars 2 Account, in addition to your desired login credentials.
			</p>
			<p>
				Raidcore will automatically get your GW2 account name and associated characters. Any encounters that have been uploaded with your GW2 account in them will immediately show up in your Encounters page.
			</p>
			<p>
				Raidcore tries to automatically detect if you have previously changed your account name and attribute those encounters to your new name. If that didn't work, please contact me directly and I will sort it out.

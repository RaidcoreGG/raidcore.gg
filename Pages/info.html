				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>
					<b>Raidcore</b>, formerly known as "Guild Lounge", started out with the vision to create <b>third party tools</b> to enhance your Guild Wars 2 experience.
					<br>
					I think I'm doing a pretty good job with that.
				</p>
				<p>
					The <a href="https://download.raidcore.gg">DESKTOP CLIENT</a> tries to make right what others (including ArenaNet) have been doing wrong for so long.
					<br>
					The all-in-one solution to manage your accounts, addons, combat logs and on top of that you also get some handy insights.
				</p>
				<p>
					In-game <a href="https://raidcore.gg/addons">ADDONS</a>, as well as an opportunity for community creators to distribute their own addons.
					<br>
					A central hub to publish addons, whose development just became a lot easier with our <b>Addon Framework</b>.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="./">LOG PARSING</a> finally puts combat data into perspective, generating not only global statistics but also individual skill performance rating.
					<br>
					Compare your performance against any other player in the game!
				</p>
				<p>With Raidcore you can:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>See global metrics about any and all encounters in the game</li>
					<li>Look up individual players or guilds and how they perform</li>
					<li>See what the most frequent squad compositions are</li>
					<li>See the best performing classes on any given encounter</li>
					<li>Link all your alt accounts to your Raidcore account to unify all your data</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Getting Started</h2>
				<p>
					Getting started is easy. Simply create a new account on the website. You will need to provide your Guild Wars 2 API Key to confirm your ownership of a Guild Wars 2 Account, in addition to your desired login credentials.
				</p>
				<p>
					Raidcore will automatically get your GW2 account name and associated characters. Any encounters that have been uploaded with your GW2 account in them will immediately show up in your Encounters page.
				</p>
				<p>
					Raidcore tries to automatically detect if you have previously changed your account name and attribute those encounters to your new name. If that didn't work, please contact me directly and I will sort it out.

				<h2>Rating System</h2>
				<p>
					Raidcore analyses combat logs generated by <a href="https://deltaconnected.com/arcdps/" target="_blank">arcdps</a> and put them into perspective.
				</p>
				<p>
					To easily understand metrics at a glance, Raidcore use the same colour scheme you're already familiar with:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li> <b style="color: var(--legendary)">Legendary</b>: <span class="gt"/> 99<sup>th</sup> Percentile </li>
					<li> <b style="color: var(--ascended)">Ascended</b>: <span class="gt"/> 90<sup>th</sup> Percentile</li>
					<li> <b style="color: var(--exotic)">Exotic</b>: <span class="gt"/> 80<sup>th</sup> Percentile</li>
					<li> <b style="color: var(--rare)">Rare</b>: <span class="gt"/> 70<sup>th</sup> Percentile</li>
					<li> <b style="color: var(--masterwork)">Masterwork</b>: <span class="gt"/> 60<sup>th</sup> Percentile</li>
					<li> <b style="color: var(--fine)">Fine</b>: <span class="gt"/> 50<sup>th</sup> Percentile</li>
					<li> <b style="color: var(--basic)">Basic</b>: <span class="lt"/> 50<sup>th</sup> Percentile</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The Top 1 performance on a given category will be marked with a special icon: <span class="rank1"/>
				</p>

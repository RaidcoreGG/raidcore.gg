					<h1>What is Raidcore?</h1>
					<p>
						Raidcore is a platform of third-party tools to enhance your experience in Guild Wars 2.
					</p>
					<p>
						It consists of three main components:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a class="locked">Leaderboards &amp; Log-Parsing</a> for personal analytics but also global metrics</li>
						<li><a href="/addons">Addons</a> to improve the in-game quality of life</li>
						<li><a class="locked ext">The Raidcore App</a>, an all-in-one solution for addons, account and combat log management</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The project aims to give players the tools to measure, compare and improve their performance,
						as well as improving the user experience.

					<h1 onclick="toggleCollapsible(this, 'calculation');" class="collapsible collapsed">How is my rating calculated?</h1>
					<section id="calculation" style="display: none;">
						<p>
							Player rating is calculated based on four combined categories, as shown below.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>Damage dealt:</b>
								the total amount of DPS you have dealt during the encounter;
								this takes both single-target, as well as cleave damage into account.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Damage taken:</b>
								the amount of avoidable damage you have received during the encounter;
								the lower, the better.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Mechanics:</b>
								your performance in regards to encounter-specific mechanics,
								i.e., whether you failed or successfully carried out said mechanics.
								Examples of this could be:
								<ul>
									<li><span style="color: #59AC62;">doing Dhuum greens</span></li>
									<li><span style="color: #59AC62;">breaking Samarog’s breakbar</span></li>
									<li><span style="color: #AC5959;">touching oil at Deimos</span></li>
									<li><span style="color: #AC5959;">getting teleported at Vale Guardian</span></li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Support:</b>
								your output of boons, unique buffs, healing and barrier during the encounter,
								as well as resurrecting your downed allies.
								<br>
								<i>It’s time to stop greeding and finally press F!</i>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							There are <u>no arbitrary values</u> that define the best and worst of a category;
							the information necessary to calculate the rating is derived from the registered extremes,
							e.g., highest and lowest DPS/healing, best boon uptime ever achieved, etc.	
							It should be mentioned however, that if your build is not capable of providing specific boons,
							or carrying out likewise specific actions (e.g., boon-stripping) to begin with,
							you naturally will not be rated on it.
							<br>
							<i>We’re not going to judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree.</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							Furthermore, your Damage Dealt rating is per specialisation, per archetype.
							For example, a chrono tank will be compared to other tanks in DPS, not to a DPS chrono.
						</p>
						<p>
							You will be rated on each profession, specialisation and role you play.
							All of them will have their own sub-rating and will be combined into an overall rating.
						</p>

					<h1 onclick="toggleCollapsible(this, 'grades');" class="collapsible collapsed">Rating System</h1>
					<section id="grades" style="display: none;">
						<p>
							To easily understand metrics at a glance, Raidcore uses the same colour scheme you're already familiar with:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b style="color: var(--gw2-legendary)">Legendary</b>: <span class="gt"/> 99<sup>th</sup> Percentile </li>
							<li><b style="color: var(--gw2-ascended)">Ascended</b>: <span class="gt"/> 90<sup>th</sup> Percentile</li>
							<li><b style="color: var(--gw2-exotic)">Exotic</b>: <span class="gt"/> 80<sup>th</sup> Percentile</li>
							<li><b style="color: var(--gw2-rare)">Rare</b>: <span class="gt"/> 70<sup>th</sup> Percentile</li>
							<li><b style="color: var(--gw2-masterwork)">Masterwork</b>: <span class="gt"/> 60<sup>th</sup> Percentile</li>
							<li><b style="color: var(--gw2-fine)">Fine</b>: <span class="gt"/> 50<sup>th</sup> Percentile</li>
							<li><b style="color: var(--gw2-basic)">Basic</b>: <span class="lt"/> 50<sup>th</sup> Percentile</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							The Top 1 performance on a given category will be marked with a special icon: <span class="rank1"/>

					<section id="unfair" style="display: none;">
						<p>
							Perhaps it should! But then again,
							your rating is calculated with the exact same algorithm that everyone is evaluated by.
							If you feel like these calculations don’t mirror your amazing skills of consuming Adrenal Mushrooms or something like that,
							let me know, so I can adjust it.

					<h1 onclick="toggleCollapsible(this, 'accuracy');" class="collapsible collapsed">Where does this data come from? Is it accurate?</h1>
					<section id="accuracy" style="display: none;">
						<p>
							The data on Raidcore is directly obtained from the EVTC log files generated by <a href="https://deltaconnected.com/arcdps/" target="_blank" class="ext">arcdps</a>.
							These files contain the data as it is reported by the Guild Wars 2 servers.
							Even if the log files were to be manipulated, Raidcore is able to detect these files and filter them out.

				<div class="container">
					<h1 onclick="toggleCollapsible(this, 'profiles');" class="collapsible collapsed">What data can I access about myself/other players/guilds?</h1>
					<section id="profiles" style="display: none;">
						<p>
							Your own profile gives you much greater insight than the (public) profiles of other players.
							For example, you will see how well you performed on DPS compared to last week,
							or how much faster or slower your full clear was, your best and worst runs, etc.
							These detailed insights will be visible to you only.
						</p>
						<p>
							Publicly shown will be your overall rating,
							but also your rating in the 4 categories (DPS, Damage Taken, Mechanics, Support),
							your endorsements, your linked GW2 accounts, your last encounters,
							also if you decide to do so, your guild affiliation.
							You will also be able to see the total amount of boss kills and again if you opt-in,
							the amount of “kill proof” you acquired. That being boss trophies,
							as well as Legendary Insights/Divinations, Titles, Miniatures and Skins.
						</p>
						<p>
							Guild pages will contain the same information as the public or private profiles,
							depending on whether you are a member of the guild or not, or the guild decided to publish this information.
							Additionally, it will contain a list of members, who decided to have their guild affiliation set to public.

					<h1 onclick="toggleCollapsible(this, 'speedruns');" class="collapsible collapsed">How does the rating account for speedruns?</h1>
					<section id="speedruns" style="display: none;">
						<p>
							Apart from Raidcore publicly showing the fastest runs for any given encounter
							to promote speedrunning and incentivise players to push their limits,
							there’s the issue that speedruns tend to do things differently than the average pug run.
						</p>
						<p>
							For example, getting boon stripped on Largos would normally decrease your mechanics rating,
							however you trade it for significantly higher DPS.
							Fear not, things like these are accounted for and in case they aren’t, reach out to us so we can fix it.
						</p>

				<div class="container">
					<h1 onclick="toggleCollapsible(this, 'toxicity');" class="collapsible collapsed">Could Raidcore incentivise toxicity?</h1>
					<section id="toxicity" style="display: none;">
						<p>
							Possibly.
							While the intent of the project is creating a healthy and positive environment for self-improvement without any kind of toxicity.
							There’s no 100% guarantee that the project isn’t being abused.
							That’s why we actively moderate the project and remove toxic users.
							In addition to that, for example the distribution of the rating or the weights of the mechanics can be tweaked,
							to allow for less disparity in skill rating.
							Also, the in-game addon, as well as the website allow you to endorse players for being friendly, good leaders or good teachers.
							This hopefully encourages players to not be toxic, as these endorsements will be shown on your profile.

							Raidcore was born with the intent to help the community and as such,

							it is being maintained by the work of <a href="/about">one individual</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							Users can donate to support the project, allowing for more time to be dedicated to it,

						<p>
							Sadly, no.
							<br>
							Due to unfortunate past experiences, Raidcore will remain closed-source,
							although some of its components are <a href="https://github.com/raidcoregg" target="_blank" class="ext">open-source</a> for the sake of transparency and collaboration with the community.
							In addition to that,
							some addons contain reverse-engineered components that ArenaNet requires to remain closed-source,
							in order to abide by the Terms of Service.
